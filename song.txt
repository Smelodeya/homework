The Tarantula Song 

Tarantulas tarantulas
Everybody loves tarantulas
If there's just fuzz where your hamster was
It's probably because of tarantulas

They're so soft and they're so furry
And they're so cute if your vision's blurry
All mine got free but don't you worry
Though they're crawling up your wall in a big hurry 

Tarantulas tarantulas
Everybody loves tarantulas
If there's just fuzz where your hamster was
It's probably because of tarantulas

Don't look now but I have a feeling
There's one above you on your ceiling
But when they crawl they never fall
Unless the person under them is nervous at all
